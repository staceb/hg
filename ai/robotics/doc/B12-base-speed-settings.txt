Some safe-seeming velocities for the robot:
  * RV 40 is smooth and slow
  * TV 600 is a good middle speed
  * TV 1000 is probably about as fast as 
    we want it to go.  At that point, stuff starts
    wiggling when it stops.

  * R> 100 ~ 90 degrees
       400 ~ 360 degrees (1024 decimal units per rotation)

  * T> 400 ~ 8cm (~ 8e-5 m/1024 decimal units)
