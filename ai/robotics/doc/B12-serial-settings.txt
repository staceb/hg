The B12 base speaks serial with the following settings:

19200 bps
8 data bits
no parity
1 stop bit
flow control off



The baud rate is supposedly configurable via a DIP switch as follows:

switch #  baud rate
1 2 3 4
- - - - 300
x - - - 600
- x - - 1200
x x - - 2400
- - x - 4800
x - x - 9600
- x x - 19200
x x x - 38400

'x' = switch in ON position

all baud rates are 8N1
