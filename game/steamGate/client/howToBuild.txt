This is a headless client that uses the Steam API to find the Steam user's
authentication credentials and then connects to the steamGate server to
set up a download ticket for this Steam user.  The credentials obtained
from the steamGate server are saved into:

settings/email.ini
settings/downloadCode.ini


The idea is that this headless client can be launched before a game from
within the game's working folder to obtain necessary login credentials before
the game runs the first time.


To build this client:

1.  Copy all Steam .h header files into a "steam" directory here.

2.  Copy the steam_api.lib (on Windows) or other platform library stub here.

3.  ./configure

4.  make


Note that the open-steamworks headers seem to be the only way to keep
MinGW builds on Windows from crashing:

To test when not launching from Steam, you may need to edit steam_appid.txt
to match the appID that you're testing.



Mac Notes:
Instead of steam_api.lib, copy libsteam_api.dylib into build directory.
